# The Communist Manifesto

## Preface

A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of Communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police spies. Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not been hit with the brand of Communism by its dominant adversaries?

We are not a party of particular interests, but the vanguard of the working class struggle worldwide. Our aim is to overthrow the bourgeois order, bring an end to class structures, and build a society of equality.

## Chapter 1: Bourgeois and Proletarians

We Communists are not concerned with any special interests of our own. We do not fight for the benefits of particular nationalities or the well-being of particular groups. We stand for the revolution that will abolish all systems of exploitation, and liberate all the oppressed.

The history of society is the history of class struggles. The class struggle will lead to the overthrow of the capitalist system, and the establishment of a classless society, where the means of production are in the hands of the working people.

The proletariat, which is the vast majority of the population, has nothing to lose but its chains. It has everything to gain by abolishing the bourgeois state and creating a socialist society.

## Chapter 2: Proletarians and Communists

We Communists do not form a separate party. We stand for the general interests of the proletariat, fighting for its liberation across all nations. Our aim is to unite the working class, create a global revolution, and abolish private property and capitalist domination.

All workers have common interests, and it is the duty of the Communists to advocate for their unity and lead them towards revolution.

## Chapter 3: Socialist and Communist Literature

The struggle for socialism is not limited to any one nation, but is a global struggle for a new world. Our theory stands against all forms of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology. It calls for the abolition of the state, the end of private property, and the establishment of a society based on equality and cooperation.
